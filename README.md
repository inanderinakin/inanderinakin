# üí´ About Me:
I'm a passionate high school student who enjoys designing websites for small organizations and also for my projects. In addition, I manage a game development studio, which allows me to improve my coding skills and pursue my interests. I've always been interested in finance, economics, and investing. As I continue learning more about coding and finance, I am increasingly drawn to artificial intelligence. It complements my primary interests in website and game development.
